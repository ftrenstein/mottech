KITTEN STERILISATION

Considering sterilisation?
THINKING ABOUT STERILISATION?
Your kitten is growing, so it could be time to start discussing with your vet about sterilisation. This is an important step. Some owners want to sterilise right away, others prefer to wait for different reasons. Either way, it should be well thought through as sterilisation has an impact on nutrition. Your vet can advise you on the best time to neuter your kitten. However, we do not recommend neutering until your kitten is 6 months old.

DID YOU KNOW?
After neutering or spaying, your kitten's energy requirements decrease by around 30% but their appetite increases. They'll need less calories to stay in great shape.
3 golden rules for taking care of your newly sterilised pet
1- Lots of rest the first few days
They have had major surgery, and it has been a rough week for them, so be gentle with your cat.
2- Take care of their scar
Especially as they start to heal. Neck cones come in handy.
3- Watch out for weight gain
Switch to a special kibble for sterilised cats to help keep their weight in check.
LAST TIP
Weigh your cat once a week for at least two months post-surgery to be sure their weight stays stable. After that, monthly weigh-ins work. A 200-g gain in a 3,5-kg cat is equivalent to an extra 3,5 kg on a grown man!
